# MNIST_Numpy_Neural_Network
Creating a neural network from scratch to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
By From scratch, I mean primarily using NumPy and Pandas and no advanced machine learning libraries.

Please refer to the Juypter notebook from Kaggle for more details and more detailed description of the project.
