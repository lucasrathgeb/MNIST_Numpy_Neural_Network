# MNIST_NumPy_Neural_Network
Created a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the classic MNIST dataset.
The neural network was created primarily using NumPy and Pandas and no advanced machine learning libraries.

Please refer to the Juypter notebook from Kaggle for more details and more detailed description of the project.
